        <h3>Personality</h3>
        <p>
          Mon is a <strong>good</strong> cat. He likes to eat fishs, but he
          doesn't like to eat canned food. He is rude when nobody is around.
          When I bring him food, he came to me quickly within 10 seconds after I
          called him.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          Mon was a <i>stray</i> kitten. He was left behind near my house. I
          decided to take care of him. He has been my best friend since that
          day.

        <p>
          Mink is a <strong>nice</strong> cat. Unlike Mon, she likes to eat
          canned food more than fishs. She rarely show rude behaviour. She is
          old and slow cat.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          Mink was in my house before I was born. That's why she was older than
          <em>Mon</em>.
